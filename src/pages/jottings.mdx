# Gatsby lesson notes

To run the markdown and parse it as html, install the following 
    npm i gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx@latest @mdx-js/react@latest

To use regular files in the data tree, install the following plugin
    npm i gatsby-source-filesystem

In GraphQl, there are nodes (data) and edges (relationship)

The gatsby-nodejs file helps to run the node apis. Ensure to not use jsx in there.

gatsby-source-filesystem helps us to associate name to folders and read it from graphql in gatsby

allFiles(filter: { sourceInstanceName: { eq: "posts"}}) {
    nodes {
        childMdx {
            frontMatter {
                title
            }
        }
    }
}

In graphql, the query parameters can be filtered (eq, ne, regex etc)

Graphql variables are created using $slug: String!

Images are stored in the static folder
